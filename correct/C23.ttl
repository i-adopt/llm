    rdfs:comment "Correlation of dose and response for nanomaterials toxicity assessment requires information on the amount of the applied dose of nanomaterial that has been internalised by a cell population (or per specific cell) and is dependent on a number of factors including the exposure time, the particle density (i.e., whether settling occurs and thus the distribution of particles in the medium is non-homogeneous affecting the local concentration at the cell surface) etc." ;
